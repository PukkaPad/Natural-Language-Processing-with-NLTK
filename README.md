New concepts to me
----------------------

## Part-of-speech tagging:
* From [wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging):
    * is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context

## Chunking:
* From the [docs](http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.chunk.html):
    * Typically, chunk parsers are used to find base syntactic constituents, such as base noun phrases
